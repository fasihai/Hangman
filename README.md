# Hangman
Hangman game in Ruby
Create a Hangman game using Ruby script, where once a new game is started, the user is given a word to guess with a clue. 
The program checks to see if the letters picked by the user matches any of the letters in the given word. 
The user is given a certain number of attempts to try to solve the word, and if they can't then they lose the game.
Also have an option to end the game or keep on playing more rounds.
